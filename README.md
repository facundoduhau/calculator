Calculator ðŸ§®ðŸ”¢

This is the fourth "The Odin Project" exercise.

The project required plenty of investigation to get to know how to cast different data types so that there are no errors whendoing the operation requested.

One of the core differences between this project and the previous ones is the use of the CSS grid, which interacts works in another way compared to Flexbox.

Pure Javascript, HTML and CSS was used to code the project.
